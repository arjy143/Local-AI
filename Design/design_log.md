# Design log

## 2/1/26

Goals:
- create a console application for programming, somewhat like claude's terminal
- run llm's locally and potentially fine tune them to be specialised for coding. Could also use other machine learning techniques instead of LLMs to enhance coding, because there's no way I can get claude opus performance out of the box with open source models.
- Also figure out how to get the models to determine commands to use when investigating a repo, or doing other system-wide actions - there could be a lot of use out of this beyond coding, such as automating notes, emails, and pretty much anything involving interacting with a computer.

Optional:
- potentially make a vim integration, vscode integration
- if the local AIs are successful, figure out how to expand their use. It would be nice to have LLM's used like a whatsapp bot that could schedule events for a group chat, set reminders, remember past conversations etc. There are many other uses as well.
